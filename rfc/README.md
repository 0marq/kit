# RFCs

This is a place to hold proposals and design discussions for components of the
Go kit.

Let's keep the process lightweight. To propose a new RFC, make a pull request
with a new file, roughly in the same format as the others. To make changes to
an existing RFC, make a pull request with your changes, and describe your
motivation in the comments.

For questions and free-form discussion, please use IRC or the mailing list.
